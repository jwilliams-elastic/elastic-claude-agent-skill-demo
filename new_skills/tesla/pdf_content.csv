Any outstanding next steps must be completed before delivery. Customer receives vehicle, signs paperwork (title transfer, registration - varies by state), pays outstanding balance. Returns accepted within 7 days or 1,000 miles. Contactless delivery customers must complete paperwork and return within 24 hours."
16,Ford Following Tesla,"Ford piloting 'Smart Labs' showrooms - 7 locations worldwide as of early 2020, located in high-traffic malls with 2-5 vehicles. 75% of people starting at Smart Labs were new to Ford brand. Ford developed online reservation system for Mustang Mach-E with $500 down-payment. ~95% of Mach-E pre-orders conducted online. Ford plans single-MSRP pricing with 3-pronged dealer compensation: delivery allowance, EV-certified guidelines compliance, not advertising below MSRP."
17,Financing Options,"Tesla offers two financing options with online application: Lease (36 months, 10k/12k/15k mileage options) and Loan (2-4 payback options depending on model). Finance options cannot be negotiated. Competitive loan terms with guaranteed vehicle resale values. Tesla does not make money on loan partnerships. Leasing program introduced 2019 with ~7% lease penetration in Q1 2020. Model 3 cannot be purchased after lease-end (intended for RoboTaxi fleet). Limitations: $100 order fee required before finance details confirmed, application only within 30 days of delivery, financing in 21 states only via partnerships with US Bank, Chase, TD Auto Finance, Wells Fargo."
18,Over-the-Air Updates Overview,"Tesla uses 'systems architecture' for software enabling continuous product improvement. Model 3 received 100+ OTA updates since mid-2017 release. Example: 'Save Dashcam Clips on Honk' released ~1 month after customer tweet. Real-time customer interventions: service technicians remotely access vehicle logs and issue software fixes, modifications can be turned on/off for multiple customers simultaneously. During Hurricane Irma 2017, Tesla temporarily enabled additional battery capacity for evacuation. OTA creates additional revenue streams - new features unlocked for fee (e.g., rear heated seats). Forbes estimates Tesla sold $1.5B in Autopilot upgrades in 2019 (~6% of revenue). OTA enables successive autonomous mobility advances."
19,OTA Monetization,"Customers purchase additional features from Tesla app or online account. Single purchase features: Acceleration Boost ($2,000), Autopilot ($3,000), Full Self-Driving ($7,000 - includes Navigate on Autopilot, Auto Lane Change, Autopark, Summon, Traffic Light and Stop Sign Control). Subscription-based: Premium Connectivity ($9.99/mo) includes Live Traffic, Satellite-View Maps, Video Streaming, Caraoke, Music Streaming, Internet Browser. Tailored emails inform customers of new features available for their vehicle."
20,OTA Types and Hardware,"Three types of OTA updates: 1. Free 'essential' updates - critical vehicle operations/safety plus user experience improvements (majority of updates). 2. Free Autopilot updates with Autopilot purchase - successive self-driving capability expansion (all cars equipped with radar, ultrasonic sensors, cameras). 3. Paid non-Autopilot upgrades - enhance features/improve performance (e.g., $300 rear heated seats, $2,000 acceleration boost). Based on vehicle teardown analysis, unlikely Tesla has numerous un-activated hardware components except for Autopilot-related hardware. Single 'loaded' trim concept where customers pay to turn features on."
21,Owner Account Features,"Tesla owner website: learn about vehicle, buy software updates, manage account, add payment method, manage multiple Tesla products, add secondary contact access, access owner's manual, view/download delivery documents. Mobile app broader features: control/locate vehicle, initiate charging, schedule service, purchase/install OTA upgrades. Financing account management NOT available through app or website. Tesla uses app as primary ownership communication channel via notifications for new software updates."
22,Service Operations,"Tesla service built around virtual maintenance: 90% of issues remotely diagnosed, 80% fixed remotely. SmartAlerts proactively diagnose issues. 80% of physical repairs can be resolved without visiting service center via mobile service (~700 units worldwide). ~400 service centers complete repairs ~4x faster using 1/3 physical space. Issues diagnosed remotely with parts ordered in advance. Challenges: service capacity may be insufficient, 25% of appointment wait times exceed 10 days, 55% of owners needed unscheduled service for paint, panel gaps, scratches, dents, rattles (build quality issues). Key dissatisfaction: 60% difficulty reaching customer service, 60% wait time for appointment, 40% parts delivery wait, 40% repair adequacy."
23,SKU Simplification,"Model 3 has ~120 total possible configurations vs Toyota Corolla 5M and Mercedes A-Class 480M. Configuration options: Vehicle (3), Color (5), Wheels (2), Interior options (2), Autopilot/AD (2). Benefits: Manufacturing planning simplified, increased parts purchase volume for supplier scale, inventory turnover higher with fewer options, regional inventory hubs carry small selection (fewer than 20 Model 3 within 200 miles of SF/LA/NYC on 5/18/20), customers make only ~5 configuration decisions, in-person onboarding completed in 5 minutes."
24,Operating Model Overview,"Tesla's agile operating model enables fast decision making. Structure: resembles tech player not traditional OEM, tech-related roles as direct reports to CEO. Centralization: R&D driven by highly centralized E/E architecture, strong emphasis on maximum standardization of key activities (digital/physical vehicle testing, vehicle data management, production integration). Culture: non-industrial DNA with Anti Anti-Handbook summarizing corporate DNA focused on fast decision making, fast-paced corporate culture challenging established standards."
25,Four Pillars of Operations,"F3 (Fast Flexible Factory) enables radical time-to-market with four key pillars: 1. Fast flexible factory F3 - high vertical integration, flexible connected control stations for material/product tracking. 2. Highly agile module manufacturing kit - machines build machines via modular product for automated production using ML/AI, E2E modular architecture. 3. Globally connected production network - one mother plant in Fremont, scalable transplant factories with 80:20 copies. 4. Digital lean production order system - high speed 5G order system with partner ecosystem, automated demand & capacity management."
26,Production Cycle Comparison,"Tesla production cycle ~12 months from ground breaking to Job #1 vs ~25 months for EU Premium OEMs. EU OEMs: 12-14 months planning, 11 months approvals/tendering, 9 months construction, 10 months equipment prep, 6 months pro-readiness, 4-6 months ramp up. Tesla: 6-8 months planning, 6 months approval/tender, 8 months construction, overlapping 2.5 months equipment installation, 5 months automatic operations, 2.5 months equipment/IT readiness, 1-3 months to Job #1. Overlap of phases drives down total time."
27,Gigafactory Comparison,"EU Premium OEMs: 20-30 months timeline, 1.5-2.0 EUR bn investment, 350-450k sqm size, vertical integration includes press, BIW, paint shop, assembly. Gigafactory 3 Shanghai: 12 months to SOP Jan 2020, ~250,000 capacity, 1.8 EUR bn investment, ~320k sqm, includes press, BIW, paint, assembly, eATS, seats, batteries.

28,Manufacturing and Vertical Integration,"Tesla has small, highly automated manufacturing footprint with 2 vehicle production factories (Fremont CA, Shanghai). 1000+ robots on assembly lines with custom-built autonomous robots designed on-site. Engineers reprogrammed robots when discovering 5,000 spot welds could be reduced by 300. Electric powertrain designed and manufactured in-house with best power-to-weight ratio. SpaceX supported with aluminum casting quality issues during Model 3 development. Challenges: Model 3 line cost ~$2B, fully automated line was error-plagued requiring temporary tent assembly line with workers replacing robots."
29,Vertical Integration Comparison,"Tesla has highest degree of vertical integration for powertrain vs competitors. Manufacturing vertical integration for TM3: Press shop 65% (vs 40% BMW, 36% Mercedes), BIW/body shell/coatings 60% (vs 80% BMW, 85% Mercedes), Powertrain/power electronics/transmission 58% (vs 28% BMW, 34% Mercedes), Chassis/steering/axles/brakes/tires 5% (vs 32% BMW, 33% Mercedes), Interior/cockpit/infotainment/seats 3% (vs 35% BMW, 32% Mercedes). Tesla at ~13 hrs/veh (9.5 hrs excluding powertrain) vs ~15-17 hrs for traditional OEMs."
30,R&D and Over-Specification Strategy,"Tesla approach: overall R&D cost higher initially but lower over time from usage in multiple generations and across vehicles. 25% R&D cost advantage through 'over-specification': parameter provisioning (computing power, memory), function provisioning (Cloud/X-to-X), ecosystem/technology provisioning (onboard/offboard, meshed technologies). Benefits: usage in at least 2 generations with ability to extend/improve, deployment of architecture across multiple vehicles, continuous development with incremental hardware upgrades every 4 years."
31,Production System Layout,"Tesla production system based on Toyota's agile production concept. Fremont plant uses machinery plug & play modules including IoT-system across smart space allocation (compact layout: 0.5M square m). Integrated and connected data stream with IoI-Production steering and planning control platform.

33,Charging Infrastructure,"Tesla rapidly expanding Supercharger network: 1,870 Supercharger Stations with 16,585 Superchargers (908 US, 98 Canada, 15 Mexico, 24K destination chargers). V3 chargers allow Model 3 to add ~100 miles in seven minutes. Full charge costs $10-20 depending on speed. Profits reinvested in network development. Gigafactory 1 battery production: 35GWh/year (goal 54GWh = ~300,000 vehicles/year). Tesla Panasonic cells $111/kWh - 20%+ lower than LG Chem (~$3K cost benefit). Customer barriers: 60% running out of power, 60% low charging availability, 40% initial cost, 40% service cost. Home charger ~$500 additional cost, most require electrician install."
34,Incentive Program Details,"Tesla pricing shows 'after potential savings' including state incentives and gas savings of $6,300. Purchase price vs savings price displayed during ordering. Autopilot available as post-purchase option for $7,000 including Full Self-Driving Computer, Full Self-Driving Capability for future purchase. Features require active driver supervision and do not make vehicle autonomous. Self-driving features evolve via OTA updates."
35,State EV Incentives,"Tesla does not offer its own vehicle incentives. Price shown during ordering includes state EV incentives. California offers $2,000 incentive for Model 3 and Model Y. Federal tax credit up to $7,500 was phased out for Tesla on 12/31/19 after reaching 200,000 cumulative vehicles. GM nearing phase-out, no other automakers reached it. 'After savings' price factors in state incentives plus estimated gas savings."
36,State Incentive Details,"State incentives vary: Arizona (reduced license tax, carpool access), California ($2,000 rebate for M3/MY), Colorado ($4,000 tax credit purchase/$2,000 lease), Connecticut ($1,500 rebate under $42K, emissions exemption), Delaware ($2,500 rebate under $60K), Hawaii (carpool access), Louisiana ($2,500 tax credit), Maine ($2,000 rebate under $50K), Maryland ($3,000 excise tax credit under $60K), Massachusetts ($2,500 rebate under $50K), Nevada (reduced charging rates), New Jersey ($5,000 rebate under $55K, sales tax exempt), New York ($500-$2,000 rebate based on price), Oregon ($2,500 rebate), Vermont (up to $5,000 based on income), Washington (sales tax reduction), Washington DC (excise exempt, 50% home charging credit up to $1,000)."
37,Distribution Network,"Tesla's factory-to-consumer network heavily concentrated on coasts. States with >5 stores: Arizona (6), California (53), Colorado (6), Florida (17), Illinois (10), Massachusetts (5), New York (9), Texas (19), Washington (8). Network includes: 5 Factories, 18 DCs/Warehouses, ~130 Delivery centers (~50% attached to stores/service centers), ~130 Stores. 'The benefit of regional distribution centers is we can quickly ship cars to customers - about a week if already made. 60% going directly to people's houses.' '~60% of cars are pre-ordered now, don't have to hold as much stock nearby.'"
38,Inventory Management,"Select Tesla showrooms and service centers have conjoined vehicle pickup lots for in-person pickup. Locations carry 'small number of cars in inventory for customers who wish to drive away immediately.' Majority of vehicles at these locations already purchased awaiting pickup/delivery. Tesla also maintains 'logistics transit hubs' as distribution centers not open to public - most vehicles already ordered. Late 2018 videos showed thousands of vehicles at lots. Vehicles move in/out daily - some inventory listed online may be stored at nearby hub, not retail location. Demand exceeding supply since inception makes it unclear if near-zero inventory is strategic or production ramp-up related."
39,Trade-In Process,"Before ordering, customer can request trade-in estimate via website calculator (VIN, year, make, model, trim, mileage, ZIP). Estimate provided within 24-48 hours based on Kelley Blue Book 'Good' values for non-Tesla, internal remarketing team for Tesla vehicles. After order, customer completes self-inspection with photos. Official offer in 24-48 hours (some report up to a week). Tesla will match higher third-party offers (e.g., CarMax), otherwise non-negotiable. Positive equity applied to purchase, negative equity paid at delivery or rolled into agreement. Trade-in dropped off at delivery appointment. Tesla partners with Manheim and Adesa auction services to dispose of trade-ins at wholesale auction."
40,Lease Returns,"Leases comprise ~7% of sales (Q1 2020). Model 3 lease program began 2019, initial returns not expected until mid-2022. Return options: Upgrade (trade for new lease), Return (return during scheduled appointment, inspection 30-60 days prior to maturity), Purchase (eligible for Model S/X based on original residual values, Model 3 ineligible - intended for RoboTaxi fleet). Process appears highly manual requiring contact with Tesla Lease Returns/Finance. ~50% of returns are retail-ready for certified pre-owned or loaners/employee cars. Manheim and Adesa sell others via wholesale auctions."
41,Infotainment Hardware Upgrade,"As of March 2020, Tesla offers 'Infotainment Upgrade' for Model S/X built March 2018 or earlier. $2,500 plus tax to replace vehicle's computer. Improvements: Performance (more responsive touchscreen, faster browser with 3D rendering), Audio (Bluetooth media album art, removes AM/FM/Sirius XM but keeps internet radio/streaming), Gaming (graphics-intense games like Beach Buggy Racing 2, Cuphead, Stardew Valley, gamepad compatibility), Entertainment (YouTube, Netflix, Hulu, Twitch via Tesla Theater, Caraoke, TRAX), Driver Assistance (Enhanced Driving Visualization for FSD owners), Security (DashCam/Sentry Mode recording for FSD vehicles), Wi-Fi (5GHz support)."
42,Sales Tax Handling,"Customers pay sales tax in the state of vehicle registration. When ordering online to Texas, Tesla charges Texas sales tax by default. If shipped to different state, customer would pay Texas sales tax upon registering in Texas. Despite legal restrictions in Texas, Tesla has improved process to minimize hiccups - prepares paperwork for customers to complete and send to DMV. Previously customers had to go in person to DMV for inspection and registration."
43,Ford Mach-E Strategy,"CarsDirect first covered Ford's new Mach-E sales strategy. Ford won't let dealers advertise Mach-E under MSRP. Move meant to 'be competitive in battery electric vehicle space by transacting the way customers want.' Tesla advertises at MSRP. Mach-E starts at $44,995 vs Model Y at $49,200. Mach-E has 'e-invoice' equal to MSRP to protect brand image and dealer margins. Ford compensates dealers via: allowance per vehicle delivered, compliance with advertising rules, being properly EV-certified."
44,Rivian EV Strategy,"Rivian takes similar direct-to-consumer approach. Two 'adventure vehicles' unveiled with 3+ more forthcoming, expected 250,000 vehicles/year by 2025. R1S electric SUV ~$72.5K base, R1T electric pickup $69K base, 400+ mile range on largest battery. Production: 20,000 units 2021, 40,000 in 2022. ~$2.85B funding from Amazon ($700M, ordered 100,000 vans), Ford ($500M, Lincoln EV canceled due to COVID), Cox Automotive ($350M for service partnership). Direct-to-consumer with $1,000 refundable preorder fee. Obtained dealer license in Arizona, seeking in MA/CA/FL/IL. Colorado amended law to exempt EV-only OEMs. Where restricted, plans to sell via neighboring state stores or online/phone."
45,Other EV Competitors,"Polestar (owned by Volvo/Geely): Partnering with Manhattan Motorcars, Galpin Motors, Price-Simms for Polestar Space showrooms in NYC/LA/SF. Customers explore with non-commissioned specialists, order online. Vehicle subscription option includes usage, insurance, maintenance. Lucid: 'Studio' at Newark CA headquarters with real vehicles, interior components, VR. More studios planned for NYC, Miami, West Palm Beach, Beverly Hills, Santa Clara, LA, Orange County. $1,000 refundable deposits accepted. Built for advanced OTA and remote diagnostics with few service centers and mobile service vans."
46,Regulatory Developments,"Legal victories allowing direct sales: New Hampshire 2013 (OEMs without existing dealers), Minnesota 2013 (reinterpretation), Washington 2014 (grandfathered Tesla), Massachusetts 2014 (court ruling), Missouri 2017 (Appeals Court ruled Dealer Association lacked standing), Wyoming 2017, Arizona 2017, Indiana 2017 (grandfathered), Rhode Island 2017, Utah 2018 (direct sale license), Michigan 2020 (legal loopholes), Colorado 2020 (EV-only manufacturers). Sales and service restrictions still exist and legal battles persist in other states."
